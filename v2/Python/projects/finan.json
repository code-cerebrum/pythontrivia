      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "A balance sheet consists of three main sections: Assets (what a company owns), Liabilities (what a company owes), and Equity (the owners' residual interest in the company)."
    },
    "explanation": "The ***balance sheet*** follows the accounting equation: ```Assets = Liabilities + Equity```. For example, if a company has ```500,000``` in assets and ```300,000``` in liabilities, its equity would be ```200,000```."
  },
  {
    "title": "Balance Sheet Equation Validation",
    "ques": "A company reports assets of $1,200,000 and liabilities of $750,000. What is the equity amount?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The equity is $450,000, calculated as: Equity = Assets - Liabilities = $1,200,000 - $750,000."
    },
    "explanation": "The ***balance sheet equation*** ensures that total assets always equal the sum of liabilities and equity. Here, the equity of ```450,000``` represents the owner's share in the business after settling obligations."

    "title": "Income Statement Purpose",
    "ques": "What is the main purpose of an income statement?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "An income statement shows a company's financial performance over a period, reporting revenue, expenses, and net profit or loss."
    },
    "explanation": "The ***income statement*** follows the formula: ```Net Income = Revenue - Expenses```. If a company earns ```100,000``` in revenue and incurs ```60,000``` in expenses, its net income is ```40,000```, reflecting profitability."
  },
  {
    "title": "Income Statement Example",
    "ques": "A company reports revenues of $500,000 and expenses of $300,000. What is its net income?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The net income is $200,000, calculated as Net Income = Revenue - Expenses = $500,000 - $300,000."
    },
    "explanation": "***Net income*** represents the company's profitability. A positive value means profit, while a negative value indicates a loss."

    "title": "Cash Flow Statement Sections",
    "ques": "What are the three main sections of a cash flow statement?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The cash flow statement has three sections: Operating Activities (cash from core business operations), Investing Activities (cash from buying/selling assets), and Financing Activities (cash from loans or owner investments)."
    },
    "explanation": "The ***cash flow statement*** helps analyze liquidity. For example, if a company has ```50,000``` net cash from operations, ```-30,000``` from investments, and ```20,000``` from financing, the total cash inflow is ```40,000```."
  },
  {
    "title": "Cash Flow vs. Profit",
    "ques": "Can a company be profitable but still have cash flow problems? Why?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Yes, a company can be profitable on the income statement but face cash shortages if revenues are tied up in accounts receivable or high capital expenditures."
    },
    "explanation": "***Profitability*** (income statement) and ***cash flow*** (cash flow statement) are different. A company might report ```100,000``` in net income but struggle with cash if customers haven't paid their invoices."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The statement of changes in equity reports changes in shareholders’ equity due to net income, dividends, and other capital changes."
    },
    "explanation": "This statement tracks how ***equity*** changes over a period. For example, if a company earns ```30,000```, issues new shares worth ```20,000```, and pays dividends of ```5,000```, the equity increases by ```45,000```."
  },
  {
    "title": "Retained Earnings Calculation",
    "ques": "A company starts the year with retained earnings of $100,000, earns $50,000 in net income, and pays dividends of $10,000. What are the retained earnings at year-end?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The retained earnings at year-end are $140,000, calculated as: Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends = $100,000 + $50,000 - $10,000."
    },
    "explanation": "***Retained earnings*** represent profits kept in the business after distributing dividends. If earnings are reinvested rather than paid out, they boost future financial stability."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The income statement reports net income, which affects retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity. The balance sheet reflects this equity, while the cash flow statement shows how cash is generated and used."
    },
    "explanation": "All ***financial statements*** are interconnected: ```Net Income (Income Statement) → Retained Earnings (Equity Statement) → Equity (Balance Sheet)```. The ***cash flow statement*** then explains actual cash movement."

    },
    "explanation": "***Current assets*** support daily operations, whereas ***non-current assets*** support long-term growth. For example, a company may have ```50,000``` in cash (current) and ```500,000``` in real estate (non-current)."

      "content": "The company has $150,000 in short-term obligations due within a year and $250,000 in long-term obligations that extend beyond a year."
    },
    "explanation": "***Current liabilities*** (e.g., accounts payable, short-term loans) need quick repayment, while ***long-term liabilities*** (e.g., bonds payable, mortgages) extend beyond a year. A high current liability amount may indicate liquidity risks."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Under accrual accounting, revenue is recognized when earned, not when cash is received. This ensures financial reports reflect real economic activities."
    },
    "explanation": "If a company sells ```10,000``` worth of goods on credit, it reports ```10,000``` in revenue immediately, even though cash may be received later. ***Accrual accounting*** prevents misleading cash-based profits."

  {
    "title": "Gross vs. Net Income",
    "ques": "A company reports $500,000 in revenue and $200,000 in cost of goods sold (COGS). What is the gross income? If total expenses are $150,000, what is the net income?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",

      "content": "Gross income = $300,000 (Revenue - COGS). Net income = $150,000 (Gross Income - Expenses)."
    },
    "explanation": "***Gross income*** is calculated as ```Revenue - COGS```, showing profitability before expenses. ***Net income*** accounts for all costs, including operating expenses, taxes, and interest."

      "content": "The cash flow statement starts with net income from the income statement, then adjusts for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital."
    },
    "explanation": "For example, depreciation reduces ***net income*** (income statement) but doesn't affect cash, so it's added back in ***operating cash flow***."
